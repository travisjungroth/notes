Look to someone who is better at you in an activity. Do your best impression of them. Try to copy them as much as possible. Include details that aren't even necessary for the activity. [[id:f8d6439d-c813-4577-888c-9f3a417fa30a][Don't find what works for you too early]].

This isn't a shortcut to mastery, but it's a faster and more sure path to proficiency. It encourages [[id:45b1be48-7670-4232-b0c8-aca17eacdda1][compartmentalizing your learning]].

Don't worry about finding your own voice. It will be there when you need it.
