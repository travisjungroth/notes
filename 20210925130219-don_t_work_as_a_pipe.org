Working as a pipe is having one-to-one relationships across what you name, define, target, record, do, etc. You act like there's only one idea, one draft, one option. You're not [[id:bec60959-e9b5-49ed-88b2-669b2979243c][explicit in your exclusions]]. It's a straight pipe from top to bottom. People do this out of fear. Fear of scope creep caused by naming things. But, you can push back.
