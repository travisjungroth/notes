Work in a way so that your choices can been seen. That means people have to see the options that you didn't choose [[id:bec60959-e9b5-49ed-88b2-669b2979243c][Be explicit in exclusions]]. Saying why is optional. People are generally more likely to agree. When they disagree, it'll be more specific. Both good things.
