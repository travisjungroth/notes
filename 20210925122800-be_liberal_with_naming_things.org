When understanding a problem, be liberal with naming things. Giving things a name doesn't mean they have to be distinct from other already named things. You can figure out the relationship after naming them.

Example: Developer, Software engineer, Front-end engineer, and Front-end person can all live on the same list.

After naming, define the relationships (if you want). They could be a subtree. They could overlap. They could be associative. They could be aliases.

Naming things doesn't mean you have to do anything with them. Better to [[id:bec60959-e9b5-49ed-88b2-669b2979243c][be explicit in exclusions]].
