I'm surprised how much I learn by reading things slowly and repeatedly. I'll read something like a problem statement three times in a row, and still get new stuff out on the third. Reading the same thing across time, like How to Solve It, also gives surprising value. Some transformation happens after a reading that's picked up by the next reading. And, there's something about reading the same thing as a slightly different person. The unchanging book creates a link across time. Point 1 -> Book <- Point 2. This is hard to get otherwise, because most things change along with us.
