The whole work of Shakespeare is about 6MB. For an impossible upper bound of hand-typing:
|         100 | words per minute    |
|           5 | characters per word |
|          60 | minuter per hour    |
|          24 | hours per day       |
|         365 | days per year       |
|          50 | years               |
|           2 | bytes per character |
| 26280000000 | bytes               |
|       26.28 | GB                  |
#+TBLFM: $1=vprod(@1..@-1)::@9$1=(@8$1) / 1000000000

Maybe more realistic:
|        15 | words per minute    |
|         5 | characters per word |
|        60 | minuter per hour    |
|         4 | hours per day       |
|       250 | days per year       |
|        20 | years               |
|         2 | bytes per character |
| 180000000 | bytes               |
|       180 | MB                  |
#+TBLFM: $1=vprod(@1..@-1)::@9$1=(@8$1)/1000000

With compression or structural sharing, I'd be lucky to get 100MB of united ideas down in my lifetime.
